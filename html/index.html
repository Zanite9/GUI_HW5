This HTML file defines the structure for an interactive Scrabble web application. The key components of the application include:

- Game Info Panel: Showcases details such as the current score, total score, highest score, remaining tiles, and dictionary information.
- Scrabble Board: A section where players can drag and drop letter tiles to form words.
- Tile Rack: Displays the player's available letter tiles, allowing them to create words by dragging tiles onto the board.
- Control Buttons: Provides options to start a new game or proceed to the next word.
- Bonus Squares: Highlights special squares, such as double-word and double-letter score tiles, with distinctive colors.

This file links to external CSS for styling and jQuery UI for enhanced interactivity. It serves as the interface for the JavaScript functionality defined in index.js.
